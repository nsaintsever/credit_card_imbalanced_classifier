# credit_card_imbalanced_classifier

In this project, I found a large dataset on credit card operations in Taiwan. Ultimately, here, the idea is to find the best classifier regarding our problem : detecting credit risk. First, I ran an EDA using pandas, numpy and data viz libraries (seaborn). It showed that we were dealing with an imbalanced dataset (30K rows - 78/22%). 
Hence, I first dealt with this using over and under sampling methods. Afterwards, I used various machine learning methods (preprocessing, models/algorithms and pipelines) to find the best fitted model.
